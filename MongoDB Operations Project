# MongoDB Operations Project

Welcome to the MongoDB Operations project!

This exercise is designed to provide you with practical experience in managing real-world datasets using MongoDB. We'll work with the MongoDB sample dataset named mflix, which features a variety of movie-related data, including collections such as movies, comments, users, and more.

## Tasks

### Getting Started

1. **Create a MongoDB Account**: Begin by setting up a free MongoDB account. You can find step-by-step instructions in [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/account/).
2. **Create a Shared Cluster**: Set up a free shared cluster, a group of servers or instances that store your data. Follow the steps outlined in [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/cluster/).
3.  **Add a database user to access your database.** This user is essential for managing database access and security. Learn how to add a user by following [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/db-user/).
4. **Configure Network Access:** Add your IP address to connect to MongoDB. Detailed instructions are available in [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/network-connections/).
5. **Load Sample Data**: Add data to your cluster by loading the sample dataset. This step is crucial for practicing database operations with real data. Follow the steps in [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/sample-data/).
6. **Get Connection String**: Obtain the connection string to connect to the MongoDB cluster. The connection string is a crucial component that enables your application to communicate with the database. You can find how to get this string from [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/).

### Exploring the Database

1. **Download MongoDB Compass**: Download MongoDB Compass, which is the GUI for MongoDB. It is the easiest way to explore and manipulate your data. Explore [the documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/master/), if needed.
2. **Connect to the Cluster**: Connect MongoDB using the obtained connection string.
3. **Opening the Database:** Open the `sample_mflix` database to explore collections.
4. **Explore the Collections**: Explore each collection in the database and try to understand the data structures of stored documents.

### Create

1. **Insert a New Document into the Users Collection**: Practice adding a new user document to the `users` collection. Include fields `name` and `email`.

### Read

1. Find all movies directed by Christopher Nolan.
2.  Find movies that include the genre "Action" and sort (descending) them by year.
3. Find movies with an IMDb rating greater than 8 and return only the title and IMDB information.
4. Find movies that starred both "Tom Hanks" and "Tim Allen".
5. Find movies that starred both and only "Tom Hanks" and "Tim Allen".
6. Find comedy movies that are directed by Steven Spielberg.

### Update

1. Add a new field "available_on" with the value "Sflix" to "The Matrix".
2. Increment the metacritic of "The Matrix" by 1.
3. Add a new genre "Gen Z" to all movies released in the year 1997.
4. Increase IMDb rating by 1 for all movies with a rating less than 5.

### Delete

1. Delete a comment with a specific ID.
2. Delete all comments made for "The Matrix".
3. Delete all movies that do not have any genres.

### Aggregate

1. Aggregate movies to count how many were released each year and display from the earliest year to the latest.
2. Calculate the average IMDb rating for movies grouped by director and display from highest to lowest.
